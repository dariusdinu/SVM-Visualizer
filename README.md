## SVM Visualizer ##

This project represents the app that I created for my Bachelor's Degree final exam. It is a tool created in order to visualize the different results achieved by tuning the hyperparameters of a SVM algorithm. The user can import their own data using a CSV file, or they can choose from four diiferent datasets already included. One can choose between four different Kernels (Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid), adjust the training sample rate, generate a confusion matrix or even see the mathematical result locally, all without the need of an internet connection.
